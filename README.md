# 👋 Hi, I'm Maroua Oukrid

I'm Maroua Oukrid, an AI and embedded systems engineer with dual master's degrees from Illinois Institute of Technology and ENSEIRB-MATMECA. My work bridges machine learning, computer vision, and real-time systems—from deploying CNNs on FPGAs for human detection to building multimodal threat recognition pipelines on Jetson platforms. I thrive at the intersection of hardware and AI, especially when it advances precision healthcare or smart automation. Whether it’s semantic segmentation, reinforcement learning, or FPGA prototyping, I’m driven by building systems that are fast, explainable, and impactful.
